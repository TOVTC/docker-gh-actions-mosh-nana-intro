# YAML is visually cleaner than JSON, but it takes a little longer to parse YAML than it does to parse JSON
# The data types are less clearly defined, so everything is first read as a string, then it is parsed into its correct data type
# YAML is typically used for configuration and JSON is used for communication such as between a client and server
