# Linux CLI
## Linux Distributions (Linux Distros)
*	Linux is open-source software, so many versions of Linux (Distributions) have been created to fit special needs like running servers, desktop computers, mobile phones, etc.
*	Some popular distros include: Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine, Fedora, CentOS, etc
    *   Most distributions support basicallyt he same set of commands, with minor differences
*	Ubuntu is one of the most popular distributions
 ## Running Linux
*	On hub.docker.com, you can search for the distribution you want to use, here, we’re using ubuntu
*	Each distribution has its own command to pull the image to your local machine
*	But you can also use the run command as an alternative
    *   docker run ubuntu
*	If you have the image already downloaded, docker will store the container with this image, otherwise it will pull it down and then store the container
*	Just running the run command causes docker to open a container and then immediately shut it because we didn’t interact with it
*	The following command shows a list of running processes or containers – adding -a to the end will show the stopped containers
    *   docker ps
*	Use the following command to run the container in the interactive mode and starts the image we have locally
    *   docker run -it ubuntu
*	This starts the shell, which takes commands and passes them to our OS kernel for execution
*	Our shell prompt might 	look something like this
    *   root@2f759e6996e9:/#
*	“root” represents the user currently logged in, which is root by default, and has the highest privileges
*	After the @ sign is the name of the machine – this container has an id that is automatically generated by docker, and is like the name of a machine
*	After : the / represents where we are in the file system (here / is root)
*	The # means I have the highest privileges because we are logged n as the root user
    *   If we logged in under any other user, we would see a .
*	In the shell, we can execute commands
    *   echo hello    (prints hello)
    *   whoami	(prints logged in user)
    *   echo $0		(prints location of the shell program)
    *   history		(prints list of recently used commands – use ! and the list number to execute the specific command)
*	In Linux, use a forward slash to separate files and directories, but in windows, use a backslash, Linux is case-sensitive
## Managing Packages
*	Most OS’s and development platforms come with a package manager such as npm, yarn, pip, NuGet, etc.
*	Ubuntu uses apt (advanced package tool)
*	The apt command has a bunch of sub commands, which are printed when the following command is executed in the Linux CLI
    *   apt
*	You can use the apt or apt-get command (but use apt) to install packages, such as nano (which is a simple Linux text editor)
*	But you can’t simply type something like “apt install nano” – Linux has a package database and this database might contain hundreds of packages, but not all of them might be installed
*	To display the packages in the database, use the following command
    *   apt list
*	Our database does not contain the nano package, so we will use the update command to update our database
    *   apt update
*	The packages included in our database from the update command are not yet installed, just included, so we can then run our install command to install nano
    *   apt install nano
*	Always run the update command before installing a package to update your package database
*	Ctrl + L clears the database
*	To uninstall a package, use the following command
    *   apt remove nano
## Navigating the File System
*	pwd – print working directory
*	ls – list
    *   ls -1 – list all files, with one file per line
    *   ls -l – long list all files (with additional details)
    *   you can add an absolute or relative path to list files in a specific directory (e.g. ls bin will show you a list of programs – some of which are commands that are run in Linux, such as pwd)
*	cd – change directory
    *   a relative path can be passed
    *   an absolute path always starts from the root directory (press tab for auto-complete, press twice to list available autocomplete directory names)
    *   ../ will bring you one level back up
    *   ~ will bring you to the user’s home directory
## Manipulating Files and Directories
*	mkdir – creates new directory
*	mv – renames files and folders or moves them somewhere else
    *   mv fold-name.txt new-name.txt
    *   mb moving-file.text file-path
*	touch – creates new file
    *   can make multiple files at once if you separate them with a space (e.g. touch file1.txt file2.txt)
*	Ctrl + W removes a whole word
*	rm – removes files
    *   remove multiple files by listing multiple file names (e.g. rm file1.txt file2.txt)
    *   remove all files matching a particular criteria (e.g. remove all files that start with “file” rm file*)
    *   -r (short for recursive) removes a directory (removes the directory and all its content recursively)
## Editing and Viewing Files
*	After installing nano with apt install nano
*	Use the nano command to start the editor
    *   Pass a file name value to name the file (e.g. file1.txt)
*	cat – short for concatenate (combines multiple files)
    *   Can also be used to see the content of a file (e.g. cat file1.txt)
    *   Good for small files with data that will fit in the window
*	more – better for reading longer files and allows you to go page by page (e.g. more etc/adduser.conf)
    *   Space brings you to the next page
    *   Enter to go down one line
    *   Does not let you scroll back up
    *   Q to exit
*	Install less using apt install less and use the less command to allow up and down 
    *   Scroll with the up and down arrows
    *   Space to go to the next page
    *   Enter to go to the next line
*	head – shows the first few lines of a file
    *   -n – specify the number of lines you want to show (e.g.  head -n 5 /etc/adduser.conf)
*	tail – show sthe last few lines of a file
    *   -n specify the number of lines you want to show (e.g. tail -n 5 /etc/adduser.conf)
## Redirection
*	Standard input and output
    *   Standard input represents the keyboard
    *   Standard output represents the screen
*	The source of the standard input and output can be changed via redirection
    *   > - redirection operator, redirects the output to a different place (e.g. cat file1.txt > file2.txt will write the contents of file1 to file2)
    *   < - redirection operator, redirects the input from the keyboard to a different place
*	cat is a command that can also concatenate file data (e.g. file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt)
*	The redirection operator can used pretty much anywhere, not just with cat
    *   E.g. echo hello > hello.txt
    *   E.g. ls -l /etc > new.txt
